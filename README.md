# French QWERTY keyboard layout for Programmers

Modified US QWERTY layout with french accents and no dead keys.

Not perfect and miss some accents (too rarely used to bother). 

Tailored for me so feel free to modify...


## Usage

Load the file with [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) and build a windows installer.
